# Bevy of Boids
Based around the simulation program boids. Describe as an emergent behavior simulation, the boids seem to behave like birds based on three simple rules of attraction, repulsion, and aligning.

I used bevy, a game engine for rust. It uses an entity, component, system design pattern(ECS). 
I used nix to make development easier, and make a development environment. You can check out all the packages in default.nix and the build script. If you have nix on your system you can run `nix-build` to compile the game.
